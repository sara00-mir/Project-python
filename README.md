The Movie Quiz App is an interactive Python-based application designed to test and enhance users' knowledge of popular, highly-rated films using IMDb datasets. Utilizing modules such as DataLoader, QuizGenerator, and QuizGame, the app efficiently loads and processes comprehensive movie data, including titles, ratings, and associated actors. Users can engage with the quiz through a console interface or a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, selecting their preferred number of questions and difficulty level. The application dynamically generates multiple-choice questions covering aspects like release years, genres, and lead actors, providing immediate feedback and tracking user performance. Visualization tools like Matplotlib display cumulative scores, offering insights into user progress. By leveraging publicly available IMDb data and open-source libraries, the Movie Quiz App delivers a scalable and engaging platform for movie enthusiasts to challenge their cinematic knowledge.
